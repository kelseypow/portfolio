      <h4>Recycling For Kids (2019)</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Senior Capstone Project<br><br>•Goal was to design safe, economical tools with which children may more easily prepare cardboard for recycling<br>•Before puberty, many children lack the strength required to fold or tear cardboard to make it fit in a recycling bin; additionally, many parents don't want to give sharp tools to their young kids<br>•The Perforating Wheel, Cardboard Punch, and Cardboard Saw were designed to ergonomically fit in the hands of children aged 5-10, and to conform with relevant ASTM and US CPSC standards<br>•SolidWorks design allowed for rapid prototyping via 3D printing and multiple iterations of tools<br>•Personal responsibilities included complete CAD design of Perforating Wheel and Cardboard Punch tools at all iterations, and safety testing<br>•Tools were tested with members of the target market at Cub Scout meetings and Boys & Girls Club events to gain feedback for design improvement<br>•CAD files may be freely downloaded from GrabCad and 3D printed directly by consumers to cut down on carbon footprints associated with manufacturing, packaging, and shipping</p>
